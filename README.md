MA8004 self-study course
`Gaussian_random_field.py` is the python codes for the project one, it is working now with seed added. Some questions need to be asked

# Things to be noticed
[X] Variogram can be computed as in the demo script, as can be checked in [Variogram](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-gstat/)

## TODO
- [ ] Maybe it can be converted to a jupyter notebook, more illustrative

- [ ] Make variation for different parameters, to investigate the variation
- [ ] Make three design strategies
- [ ] total, partial, sum over average
- [ ] try to simulate Trygve's data, make it in 3D
