### Important to note
- Hessian matrix is dependent on data, thus it is not balanced because of the randomness induced by the data. Numerically more stable way is to take the expected value of the random observations $\frac{1}{2}$

# Potential questions
- why use hessian, expected?
- does data have influence on the decision, sequential design
